        <h1>This Day Is Yours</h1>
        <p>
            You are the quiet miracle in my everyday life.  
            With you, time slows, the world softens, and love feels real.
        </p>
	<p>
		Your laugh lifts my tired moments, your warmth makes even ordinary days feel meaningful. 
	</p>
	<p>
		With you, time slows in the best way, and the world feels kinder, brighter, more alive. I’m grateful for your heart, your strength, your softness, and the way you turn love into something I can feel in every breath. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Today is about celebrating you, but for me, every day already is.
